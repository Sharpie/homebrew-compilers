**NOTE**

This repository contains experimental formulae that are very much under
construction. Rebases will happen, everything may be broken.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap Sharpie/compilers` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install homebrew/science/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:


    brew install https://raw.github.com/Sharpie/homebrew-compilers/master/<formula>.rb


Docs
----
